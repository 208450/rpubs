    Includes sample data.

+ spatial network analysis

    How to transform SpatialLines to graph, which enables network analysis and to to find shortest path between two points.

+ segmentation of spatial lines

    Functions to cut SpatialLines object into segments with even size and return them as a SpatialLines object.
